# DBD.js-Example
A Simple and Easily Explandable Discord Bot Template Made with the [DBD.js NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dbd.js).

## What you need:
- User ID [How do I get an User ID?](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID)
- Discord Bot Token [How do I make a Discord Bot or a Bot Token?](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)
- Bot Prefix [What is a Prefix?](https://maah.gitbooks.io/discord-bots/content/getting-started/prefix-and-more-commands.html)
- Hex Color [Where can I find a Hex Color?](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/)

## How to setup:
  1. In `config.json` put all of the values stated (bot token, owner id, default hex color, prefix)
  2. Invite the bot to your server [Invite Link Generator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html)
  3. Run it!

## How to run:
- I reccomend using Danbot Hosting as they are free and easy to use. Simply go to their [server](https://discord.com/invite/92HBc2Z) and check out the getting started channel!

## Code Support:
- DBD.js has their own [discord server](https://discord.gg/bRzSDjRrYs) with support channels that you can ask for any help related to the package itself!

This will be updated with more additions in the future!
